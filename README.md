An IP(Internet Protocol) address is an identifier assigned to each computer and other device(e.g., router, mobile, etc) connected to a TCP/IP network that is used to locate and identify the node in communication with other nodes on the network. IP addresses are usually written and displayed in human-readable notation such as 192.168.1.35 in IPv4(32-bit IP address)
